<p>If you choose to enable "Remember me", then we implement that by putting a cookie with your name on your device.</p>
<p>That's so that if you visit this web site again, then you won't need to re-enter your user name.</p>
<p>I think this counts as a "Preferences cookies" (a.k.a. a "Functionality cookie") according to the
    <a href="https://gdpr.eu/cookies/">GDPR</a>.</p>
